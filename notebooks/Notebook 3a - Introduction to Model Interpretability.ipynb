Imagine having an interpretable model such as linear regression or decision trees, but an explanation that looks at hundreds or thousands of variables, it would be really hard for any human to digest that explanation!\n",
    "3. **Consistent with prior beliefs** - Model explanations are greatly affected by how people perceived them. As such, when *an explanation is consistent with the prior beliefs of an individual*, they tend to favor such explanation ( also known as **confirmation bias**). This is not to discredit any novel or serendipitous discoveries of the model explanation. However, having an explanation that is in line with a domain expert, helps in the model's adoption.
